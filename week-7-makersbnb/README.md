## Week 7: MakersBnB

During this week, you'll work in teams to [build a program according to a specification][makersbnb].  Technically, a lot of what you do will be a recap of the preceding weeks.

### This module's main goals

By the end of this module all developers can:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review
* Recognise that contributions to teamwork do not always involve writing code

### Tools and Resources

* [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a todo list with superpowers!
* [Miro](https://miro.com/) is a great tool for keeping all your team's plans and reflections in one place. You can use it alongside or instead of Trello.
* [A brief into to git branching workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8&ab_channel=GitHubTraining%26Guides)
* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a lovely resource for learning about how git branches work.
* And [here's](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) Git's docs on branching.

### Your schedule

Some team meetings have been added to your schedule already:

1. Team standups, where you'll quickly check in with each other and communicate your plans for the day.  Keep them brief. If you need time to discuss things in more detail, add specific meetings to your agenda for that.
2. Team stand downs, where you'll quickly reflect on how your day has gone.  Again keep them brief.
4. Sprint planning, where you'll aim to plan what work your team will take on in the next sprint.
5. Sprint review, where you look back on the work done in the current sprint. If you had clients, they'd be in the room for this one.
5. Sprint retrospectives, where you'll seek answers to the question "how can we be a better team?".  You'll think about what you did well, what could be improved and what actions you'll take to realise those improvements.

You might consider adding these to your schedule:

1. Independent learning.  Make sure you strictly time box this and always include time for sharing what has been learned.  I'd recommend that you keep these to 45 minutes plus 15 minutes for sharing.
2. Mobbing.  This is where you all 'gather around' one machine and write code together. It can be useful to have 3+ brains and pairs of eyes on a problem but these sessions can become tiresome.  Again, you should strictly time box these sessions.  You should also watch out for signs of disengagement â€“ if you see them, it's time to mix things up.

### Why so many meetings??

For some of you, this will seem like overkill and you'll want to 'just get cracking', or something like that.  These meetings, however, are designed to ensure that by the time you do get cracking, you are happier and more productive.

1 hour spent working on a really well understood task, pulling in the right direction, is worth infinitely more than 2 hours working on a poorly defined task, creating something that doesn't meet the specifications.

### Who will facilitate your meetings?

On placement, you'll work in multidisciplinary teams, with people like Deliver Mangers and Product Managers, who provide vision and support.  This week, you'll do a lot of these things for yourselves.  I'd recommend that each day you nominate someone to facilitate team meetings.  Ideally, everyone in the team has at least one day in this role.

As facilitator, your most important job is to create and maintain a friendly space so that everyone in the team feels comfortable contributing.  You might occasionally need to take a step back in order to do this well.

### What are the hallmarks of a great team?

How many of these can you tick off?

   [ ] We all understand every ticket in the backlog\
   [ ] We do not have to ask for clarity on tickets in the middle of a sprint\
   [ ] All of our code is peer reviewed\
   [ ] We are sharing knowledge within the team\
   [ ] We all feel comfortable speaking openly in team retrospectives

What would you add to the list?
