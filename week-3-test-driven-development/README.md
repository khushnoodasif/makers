## Week 3: Test-Driven Development

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Gather evidence and use reflection to choose goals and track their progress
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I test-drive my code
* I use a methodical approach to solving problems
* I use my own initiative

Remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

For some skills, there are several options so that you can spend some time focusing on that one skill, if that's the best use of your time right now.  There is no expectation that you or anyone else will complete all the exercises.
