## Week 8: Learn A New Language

In this module you'll focus on developing a great process for learning a new language.  From time to time you should ask yourself this question: what would my plan be if I were to start learning another new language tomorrow?  You might find that your answer to this question changes during the week.

You'll either be learning Javascript (using the materials outlined below), [Java](https://github.com/makersacademy/java-apprenticeship-module) or [Python](https://github.com/makersacademy/python-music-player-challenges).  The goals are the same, either way.  If you're not sure which track you should take, please reach out to your coach.

### Javascript

> For the Javascript track, read on.  If you're due to learn Java or Python, please go back to the relevant link up there �
If you already know some Javascript, please keep an open mind and pay close attention to how the week is structured. If you can do this really well, you'll come away with some insights into how to learn new programming languages.

#### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Describe a process for learning a new language
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language
* Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I can design and build user interfaces
* I test-drive my code
* I use my own initiative

#### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

#### Individual challenge

For this module there are several options.  You should take a moment to decide which is the right one for you before getting started.  If you choose something and regret it, go back and choose something else! :)

* Create a JS app that fulfils the [Office Management Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/office-management-challenge#task)
   - A familiar problem in a new language
   - Do this one if you would like to focus on basic Javascript syntax
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
* Create a JS app that fulfils the [Takeaway Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge#task)
   - Towards the end of the Takeaway challenge, you'll have fun sending text messages with the Twilio API! :)
   - Do this one if you want something a little bit more challenging
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
