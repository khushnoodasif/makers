# Intro to the web

## Learning objectives

### Goals

This challenge directly addresses three of the weekly goals

* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle
* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Write feature tests using Capybara

You will also have opportunities to address the other three

* Follow an effective process to debug web applications
* Explain and diagram the MVC pattern

## On Thursday afternoon
On Friday you'll be tasked with putting everything you've covered into practice in the end of module challenge. To help you get ready for that, make some time on Thursday to reflect, with your pair, on everything you've covered this week.
