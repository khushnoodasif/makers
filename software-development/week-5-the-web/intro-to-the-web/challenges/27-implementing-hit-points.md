# Implementing Hit Points

We have just refactored our code, separating our Controller layer from our Model layer. This refactor will make it easier to approach our next User Story:

```
As Player 1,
So I can start to win a game of Battle,
I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP by 10
```

In this challenge, you will implement a feature that meets this User Story. You should make only minimal changes in views or in the controller: almost all the changes required to solve this can happen in the Model.

### Learning Objectives Covered

By test driving this user story which adds more logic to your application, you are working towards:

* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Write feature tests using Capybara

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [x] Write a feature test for the User Story above
- [x] Pass this test with minimal implementation.
