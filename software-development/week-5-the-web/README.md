## Week 5: The Web

This week is about learning how to build web applications in Ruby, using TDD.

### This module's main goals
By the end of the week:
* Write feature tests using Capybara
* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Follow an effective process to debug web applications
* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle
* Explain and diagram the MVC pattern

### Resources

* [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) â€“ you'll probably get asked about this in a job interview one day ;)
* [History of the web](https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw59n8BRD2ARIsAAmgPmJcknSPKlT1ckzH7grP8DX_Mxr1be9qlqv13OEC9aI7pYe0CJoAVKQaAikrEALw_wcB)

### Overview

I have learned a lot about how the web works as well as how to interact with different websites and use the terminal. Although I understand the very basics of this module, it is very difficult for me to build it without using a guide or looking online for answers. As a result of this module, I feel like I need to put more effort into understanding concepts outside of apprenticeship. Unfortunately, I do not have any free time outside of work. In order to complete my work, I will take notes as I go. By not making notes, I have forgotten what I've learned and have to constantly review previous sections of the module. While this unit gives many tasks with walkthroughs, I found it more challenging because some of the errors I encountered weren't very straightforward. This took me a while to figure out. Throughout this course, I learned how every single line of code matters as this can cause big issues and prevent your code from even being able to run locally.
