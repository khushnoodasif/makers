## Weeks 1 & 2: Basic Programming

During these first two modules, I will learn to use the essential tools of software development, the basic syntax of Ruby and you'll build procedural programs.

By the end of modules 1 & 2 I can:

* Navigate a unix command line
* Version control projects
* Write a procedural program
* Use a process for solving a problem

### Week 1: Overview
This first week has been quite productive and I have managed to complete all the tasks listed above, including module 1 and 2. By splitting up the mastery quizzes over multiple days, I completed them efficiently. Other learners frequently helped me with problems I encountered on a daily basis, which led to me achieving my daily tasks.

### Week 2: Overview

During the first half of the week, I accomplished TDD and Pair Programming using [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/stephaniesomade/fizzbuzz) and completed the student directory challenge. However, I was not able to complete the extra exercises. Though I understood most of the concepts, I had trouble implementing them from scratch. I received a lot of help from my pair partner with my chapter 11 quiz and this enabled me to complete that challenge as well.
