## Week 8: Learn A New Language

In this module I'll focus on developing a great process for learning a new language.

### Javascript

#### This module's main goals

By the end of the module I can:

* Describe a process for learning a new language
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language
* Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I can design and build user interfaces
* I test-drive my code
* I use my own initiative

#### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

#### Individual challenge

* Create a JS app that fulfils the [Office Management Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/office-management-challenge#task)
   - A familiar problem in a new language
   - Do this one if you would like to focus on basic Javascript syntax
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
* Create a JS app that fulfils the [Takeaway Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge#task)
   - Towards the end of the Takeaway challenge, you'll have fun sending text messages with the Twilio API! :)
   - Do this one if you want something a little bit more challenging
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
  
### Overview 

Due to the fact that I wasn't feeling well, I didn't use a lot of the time I had to focus on this as it was only following written instructions.
