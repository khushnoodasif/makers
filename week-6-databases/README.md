## Week 6: Databases

This week, you'll learn how to build database-backed web applications.  Along the way, you'll build your own [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataMapper). Bear in mind that you'll probably never have to do this again – you'd use an existing tool like [Active Record](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord) or [Ruby Object Mapper](https://rom-rb.org/) instead – but building your own tools is a great way to learn how they work.

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Diagram the data flow from user action to server resource and back again
* Explain the basics of how databases work, including:
   - What tables are and how they are structured
   - What structured query language (SQL) is used for
   - One to one relationships
   - One to many relationships
   - Many to many relationships
* Follow an effective debugging process for database-backed web applications
* Build a simple web app that can read from and write to a database

### Exercises for self-directed learning
