## Setting up a Web Project

We've written a user story and we have an idea of the first interaction, before we can start implementing this feature we need to **set up a basic Ruby web project**.

> We're going to use Capybara with RSpec and Sinatra.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Build a simple web app that can read from and write to a database
  * Set up a Ruby web project.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Set up Sinatra with RSpec and Capybara.
- [ ] Set up a 'Hello, world' Sinatra application.
- [ ] Test drive a simple index page for your bookmark manager.

> Optional set up steps
- Now is a good time to set up linting and test coverage reporting - we recommend using Rubocop and SimpleCov. Doing this early will help you to keep your code clean and test coverage high.
- You can optionally use Rackup to run your Server.
