# The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

As we have seen, the web is a system of clients and servers talking to each other. But how do they talk to each other? Usually, clients and servers talk to each other using the **HyperText Transfer Protocol**. A client makes a **request** to a server and gets back a **response**. It is called a "protocol" because it has a defined structure for requests and responses.

In this challenge you will look at the important elements of an HTTP request and response from the command line.

### Learning Objectives Covered
