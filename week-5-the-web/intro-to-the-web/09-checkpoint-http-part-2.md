# Checkpoint: HTTP Part II

Time to pause and reflect on what you've learned so far, so that you can track your progress towards the goals of this week.

The last four steps in this challenge focused on two of the weekly goals:

* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle
* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app

#### Each step has taken you a little bit closer to achieving those goals

* In step 1, you learned how to build your own server, using Sinatra.

* In step 2, you added a route to your Sinatra application.

* In step 3, you added some more routes to your Sinatra application.

* In step 4, you make your routes return HTML.

#### Now test yourselves

- [ ] Explain the code in your application to your rubber duck or another inanimate object. Make a note of anything that you struggle to explain. Compare your list with that of your pair and help improve each other's understanding.
- [ ] Revisit the list of knowledge gaps that you made at the last checkpoint. Can you cross any off?
- [ ] Do another diagram showing a request from client to server. This time, you'll be able to add more detail to the response. Make a note of any gaps in your knowledge â€“ some of them will be filled by doing this exercise.
