# Single Responsibility Principle, anyone?

We just implemented a User Story almost entirely from the Model layer. Before we proceed to the next one, let's make sure our Model is following OOD best practices.

At current, our `Player` model is responsible for two main things: managing its hit points, and attacking other players.

In this challenge, you will extract a model capable of performing attacks from the `Player` model, without breaking any feature tests.

### Learning Objectives Covered

By refactoring your application, you are working towards:

* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Write feature tests using Capybara

You are also applying a _best practice_ â€“ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [x] Extract the `#attack` method (and associated tests) into a `Game` class
- [x] Refactor your controller so it uses a `Game` instance to make an attack.
