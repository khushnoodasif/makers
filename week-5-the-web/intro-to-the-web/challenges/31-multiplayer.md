# Multiplayer

Our game can now attack a player and change turns. It shows us hit points, and we can damage player hit points. Now it's time to get two players in on the fun.

Here are our User Stories:

```
As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to losing,
I want to see my own hit points
As Player 1,
So I can lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2 to attack me, and I want to get a confirmation
As Player 1,
So I can start to lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2's attack to reduce my HP
```

In this challenge, you will implement two-player functionality.
