# Checkpoint: Web Applications

You've now covered these learning objectives:

* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle
* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Write feature tests using Capybara

And, unless everything worked first time, you also had opportunities to work towards this one:

* Follow an effective process to debug web applications

## What next?

So, what comes next?

### Test yourselves

Imagine that you and your pair have been tasked with building a Sinatra application to fulfil this set of requirements

- When a user navigates to `https://caclulator.com/addition`, they should be greeted by a welcome page
- The welcome page should have a friendly message and a form
- The form should have three fields
  - One for the user's name
  - One for the first number
  - One for the second number
- The form will also need a submit button
- When the form is submitted, the user is directed to a new page, showing a friendly message that includes their name and the sum of the two numbers

Now spend 10 mins thinking about how the application would work, based on the things you've covered so far.

- What would the request / response cycle look like?  Can you diagram it?
- What would the route look like?
- What would the `erb` files look like?

### Consolidate and Dive Deeper

In the remaining challenges, you will build a game that is played over the web and, in so doing, you will consolidate some of the things you've already learned. You'll also diver deeper into a few areas such as testing with Capybara and implementing more complex server side logic.

When you're ready, go to the next challenge to get started!
