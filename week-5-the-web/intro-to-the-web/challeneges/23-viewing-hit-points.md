# Viewing hit points

We've passed our first User Story and refactored to use a POST-redirect-GET pattern. You might notice that we have been sticking closely to the Red-Green-Refactor loop. It's easy to refactor when we have thorough feature tests, as we'll know straight away if we break anything!

Let's consider the second User Story:

```
As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to winning
I want to see Player 2's Hit Points
```

In this challenge, you will implement a simple User Story driven by Capybara. There is less support in this challenge: if you need guidance, check [the entering players challenge](entering_players.md), which follows similar steps.

### Learning Objectives Covered

By completing the second user story, you are working towards:

* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Write feature tests using Capybara

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Interpret the user story and consider exactly what the user will see, once it is completed
- [ ] Write a feature test for the User Story above
- [ ] Pass this test with minimal implementation.
