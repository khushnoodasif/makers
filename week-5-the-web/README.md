## Week 5: The Web

This week you'll learn how to build web applications in Ruby, using TDD.

### This module's main goals
By the end of the week, all developers can:
* Write feature tests using Capybara
* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Follow an effective process to debug web applications
* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle
* Explain and diagram the MVC pattern

Before you start, take a moment to think about how you will track your progress towards these goals. Write down your plan and share it with your peers.

Then, every morning, you should come back to these goals and rate your progress.

On Friday, you'll do a solo exercise which will help you to test your self assessment.
### Resources

* [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) â€“ you'll probably get asked about this in a job interview one day ;)
* [History of the web](https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw59n8BRD2ARIsAAmgPmJcknSPKlT1ckzH7grP8DX_Mxr1be9qlqv13OEC9aI7pYe0CJoAVKQaAikrEALw_wcB)

### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.  They will help you work towards this week's goals.  If you're not sure what to do, reach out to a coach right now!  Don't hesitate :)

> WATCH OUT, REMOTE WORKERS!!  Some of these exercises ask you to collaborate with another learner and send messages from your machine to theirs. This will not work as described unless you're on the same network, so you won't be able to do those few parts whilst working remotely.
