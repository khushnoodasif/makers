## Week 3 & 4: Test-Driven Development

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Gather evidence and use reflection to choose goals and track their progress
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Complete golden square challenges

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I test-drive my code
* I use a methodical approach to solving problems
* I use my own initiative

# The Golden Square Challenges

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/golden_square/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

In this module your objectives are:

* Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
* Learn to break programs up into classes.
* Learn to debug your programs.
* Learn to build software as a pair.
* Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and
  pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and
challenges over two weeks.

### Phase Zero: The Golden Square Practices

Review these so that you can refer back to them as you work through the
challenges.

1. [A concise explanation of The Golden Square](pills/the_golden_square.md)
2. [Just Enough Git to Get Started](pills/just_enough_git.md)
3. [Just Enough Structure To Pair](pills/just_enough_pairing.md)

### Phase One: Testing Bites

A series of exercises designed to help you learn how to write tests with RSpec.

1. [Testing Methods With Equality](bites/01_testing_methods_with_equality_bite.md)
2. [Testing Classes With Equality](bites/02_testing_classes_with_equality_bite.md)
3. [Testing For Errors](bites/03_testing_for_errors_bite.md)

### Phase Two: Challenges

A series of challenges designed to help you learn a strong test-driving,
object-oriented design, and debugging practices.

1. [Create Your Project](challenges/01_create_your_project.md)
2. [Test Drive a Single-Method Program](challenges/02_test_drive_a_single_method.md)
3. [Design a Single-Method Program](challenges/03_design_a_single_method.md)
4. [Intermezzo: Debugging 1](challenges/04_intermezzo_debugging_1.md)
5. [Test Drive a Class](challenges/05_test_drive_a_class.md)
6. [Design a Class](challenges/06_design_a_class.md)
7. [Intermezzo: Debugging 2](challenges/07_intermezzo_debugging_2.md)
8. [Test Drive a Class System](challenges/08_test_drive_a_class_system.md) :construction:
9. [Design a Class System](challenges/09_design_a_class_system.md)
10. [Adventure](challenges/10_adventure.md)

### Phase Three: Project

[A project to tackle solo to test your skills.](projects/README.md)

If you finish this, send your coach a message. Share with them anything you
would like to work on or a skill you would like to train and they will guide
you.
