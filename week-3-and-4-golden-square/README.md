## Week 3 & 4: Golden Square Challenges

### This module's main objectives are:

* Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
* Learn to break programs up into classes.
* Learn to debug your programs.
* Learn to build software as a pair.
* Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and
  pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

## Sequence

### Phase Zero: The Golden Square Practices

Review these so that you can refer back to them as you work through the
challenges.

1. [A concise explanation of The Golden Square]()
2. [Just Enough Git to Get Started]()
3. [Just Enough Structure To Pair]()

### Phase One: Testing Bites

A series of exercises designed to help learn how to write tests with RSpec.

2. [Testing Classes With Equality](phase-01-testing-bites/testing-classes-with-equality)
3. [Testing For Errors](phase-01-testing-bites/testing-for-errors)

### Phase Two: Skill Challenges

A series of challenges designed to help learn a strong test-driving,
object-oriented design, and debugging practices.

1. [Create Your Project]()
2. [Test Drive a Single-Method Program](phase-02-skill-challenges/01-test-drive-method)
3. [Design a Single-Method Program](phase-02-skill-challenges/02-design-method)
4. [Intermezzo: Debugging 1](phase-02-skill-challenges/03-debugging-1)
5. [Test Drive a Class](phase-02-skill-challenges/04-test-drive-class)
6. [Design a Class](phase-02-skill-challenges/05-design-class)

8. [Test Drive a Class System](phase-02-skill-challenges/07-test-drive-class-system)
9. [Design a Class System](phase-02-skill-challenges/08-design-class-system)

### Phase Three: Mocking Bites

Series of exercises designed to help learn how to isolate
tests using RSpec.

1. [Unit Testing Parent-Child Classes](phase-03-mocking-bites/01-unit-testing-parent-child-classes)
2. [Crafting Doubles](phase-03-mocking-bites/02-crafting-doubles)
3. [Unit Testing Peer Classes](phase-03-mocking-bites/03-unit-testing-peer-classes)
4. [Unit Testing API Requests](phase-03-mocking-bites/04-unit-testing-API-requests)
5. [Unit Testing Terminal IO](phase-03-mocking-bites/05-unit-testing-terminal-IO)

### Phase Four: Solo Project

Solo project designed to test all the skills.

[Takeaway Project](phase-04-solo-project/takeaway)

### Phase Five: Challenge Project

Extra tricky challenge project designed for engineers who
reach the end of the sequence and want to really test their skills.

### Week 3: Overview

Week 3 was challenging because so much new information had to be taken in. While I have been able to complete 80% of the module in the first week, my understanding is still very faint. I need to spend some time relearning and practicing TDD and OOD. Many of the challenging exercises were completed using pair programming because there were not many solutions. I was able to learn some new ways of working after having someone to work with.

### Week 4: Overview

Week 4 started with mocking bite challenges. Learning these and understanding them helped a great deal with learning OOD. It gave me more confidence to take on a solo challenge after pairing and completing these challenges. I was able to use TDD and ODD to finish most of the solo project on Takeaway, but I had difficulty using Twilio API to send sms to customers if they have placed orders. It was more difficult as the mocking bites API didn't go into detail about how to set it up yourself, use doubles, etc. I will have to go back and study up on this part of the module again.
