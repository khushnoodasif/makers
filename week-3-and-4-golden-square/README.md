## Week 3: Test-Driven Development

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Gather evidence and use reflection to choose goals and track their progress
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I test-drive my code
* I use a methodical approach to solving problems
* I use my own initiative

Remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

For some skills, there are several options so that you can spend some time focusing on that one skill, if that's the best use of your time right now.  There is no expectation that you or anyone else will complete all the exercises.

# The Golden Square Challenges

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/golden_square/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

In this module your objectives are:

* Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
* Learn to break programs up into classes.
* Learn to debug your programs.
* Learn to build software as a pair.
* Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and
  pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and
challenges over two weeks.

## Sequence

**Some of these materials are still under development. The :construction: emoji
indicates where material after this may be incomplete. It will be fully complete
within a week.**

### Phase Three: Project

[A project to tackle solo to test your skills.](projects/README.md)

If you finish this, send your coach a message. Share with them anything you
would like to work on or a skill you would like to train and they will guide
you.
