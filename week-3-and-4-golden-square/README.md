## Week 3 & 4: Golden Square Challenges

### This module's main objectives are:

* Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
* Learn to break programs up into classes.
* Learn to debug your programs.
* Learn to build software as a pair.
* Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and
  pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and
challenges over two weeks.

## Sequence

### Phase Zero: The Golden Square Practices

Review these so that you can refer back to them as you work through the
challenges.

If you finish this, send your coach a message. Share with them anything you
would like to work on or a skill you would like to train and they will guide
you.

### Week 3: Overview

Week 3 was challenging because so much new information had to be taken in. While I have been able to complete 80% of the module in the first week, my understanding is still very faint. I need to spend some time relearning and practicing TDD and OOD. Many of the challenging exercises were completed using pair programming because there were not many solutions. I was able to learn some new ways of working after having someone to work with.
