# Threat Modelling Challenges

:information_source: For the following set of challenges, you will only get the relevant information for the first question of the 4-question TM framework we saw in the TM workshop: *What are we working on?*

:comet: Your task will be to apply the full 4-question TM framework for each of the exercises. The idea is that you are able to identify potential threats and apply corrective actions if relevant.

At the end of the week, there will be a session to go through each of the challenges in further details. This will be a great opportunity to showcase the work you've done and also to answer some questions and ask any you may have :relaxed:

It's time to get started. Good luck and have fun! :dizzy:

## Categorising Threats

For the challenges below, we are going to use a structured and systematic approach to identify and categorise attacker goals. The approach that we are going to use is called [STRIDE](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride).

Note that the challenges will be increasing in difficulty as you progress through them. You got this though :star:
