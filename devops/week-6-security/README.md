# Securing Cloud Applications

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss the important things for the week
2. We'll have a short Q&A
3. You'll get into your teams and start with the [project for this week](https://github.com/makersacademy/insecure-acebook)

## Overview of the week

- You'll work in teams to apply security improvements to an existing application using SAST and DAST tools
- There will be a session about Threat Modelling (TM)
- You'll work in teams to apply TM to different scenarios presented
- There will be a session on Friday to go through the TM challenges
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Do I have security in mind when working with applications and incorporating best DevOps practices?**
* **Can I see the benefits of SAST and DAST tools and then incorporate these into a project?**
* **Am I able to get into the shoes of an attacker?**
* **Do I understand the benefits of applying Threat Modelling practices early on within the SDLC?**
* **Am I more proactive now when it comes to raising security concerns?**
* **Do I have a better understanding now of what the security responsibilities of companies and cloud providers are?**

## Security: Who should care?

Short and long answer: Everyone should care!

**Security of the Cloud vs Security in the Cloud**
- :question: What is the difference between these two?
- :question: Who is responsible for meeting each of these two?

## SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Also referred to as *Source Code Analysis Tools*.

- :question: What is SAST?
- :question: How can we leverage the use of such tools to spot security concerns?
- :question: What could be some of their weaknesses?

## DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

Also referred to as *Vulnerability Scanning Tools*.

- :question: What is DAST?
- :question: How can we leverage the use of such tools to spot security concerns?
- :question: What could be some of their weaknesses?
