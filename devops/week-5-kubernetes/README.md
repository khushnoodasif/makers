# Kubernetes (K8s)

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss the important things for the week
2. We'll have a short Q&A
3. You'll get into your teams and start with the [project for this week](#metapod-project)

## Overview of the week

- There will be a session about Container Orchestration and another one about running K8s locally
- You'll work in teams to build your own K8s cluster using EKS on AWS (Your coach will announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll work on some K8s further challenges with your local clusters
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you explain and use common Container Orchestration practices with K8s along with listing its main benefits and problem it solves?**
* **Can you diagram the K8s cluster architecture and the different pieces that take part in it?**
* **Can you work as part of a team to build your own EKS cluster?**
* **Can you build your own K8s clusters locally using K3d?**
* **Do you have an understanding of the main differences between running your own K8s cluster locally as opposed to using a service to provision them from AWS?**

## Managing K8s clusters

A K8s cluster can be difficult to build, configure and get started with. Or perhaps some companies see little RoI on managing their own K8s clusters.

So there are a bunch of solutions provided out there that fully-manage our control plane, EKS is one of them.

EKS is a managed service to simplify running K8s clusters on AWS. You don't need to install or operate your own K8s control plane or worker nodes.

## Metapod project

You are going to work in teams now! Fork [this repository](https://github.com/makersacademy/metapod) and get started :bug:
