# K8s Further Challenges

## Introduction

You will work in pairs (you may have to work solo if we're odd numbers!) to tackle a series of challenges that will help you enhance your knowledge working with K8s locally.

## How to work on the challenges

:boom: We suggest you work on these challenges following the ping-pong pairing style, e.g. Student A and Student B are working together:
- A will do the first task on their machine, then B will follow and do the same.
- After both have completed the first task, A will start with the second task, and so on...

:exclamation: Make sure you ask each other questions and validate your knowledge and assumptions as you go. As usual, please ask other peers in your cohort channel (and eventually your coach) if you would like to clarify something.

## Challenges

To get started, head to the [challenges specs](k8s-further-challenges-specs.md) and follow the specifications and questions for each task. Please work on them sequentially as they build on top of each other.

Have fun and good luck with these! :sparkles:
