3. You'll get into your teams and run through the [project setup](#project-setup)

## Overview of the week

- You'll work in teams to build your own CI-CD solution using Jenkins, and also to deploy a static website which will consume an AWS Lambda (Your coach will announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a session about CI-CD and another one about Serverless
- (Optional): There may be team presentations on Friday, depending on interest
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week
You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you work as part of a team to build your own CI-CD solution using Jenkins?**
* **Can you work as part of a team to deploy a static website on AWS using your own CI-CD solution?**
* **Can you work as part of a team to create a basic serverless architecture for your static website?**
