# Terraform and Azure

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss the important things for the week
2. We'll have a short Q&A
3. You'll get into your teams and run through the [project tasks](#project-setup-and-sections)

## Project overview

- You'll work in teams to set up two separate workflows: one to manage and deploy your infrastructure on Azure using Terraform and another one to deploy an existing application on Azure
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a session about IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Project goals

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you explain what IaC (Infrastructure as code) is?**
* **Are you able to set an automatic workflow on GitHub Actions to manage your project infrastructure using Terraform?**
* **Can you set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your application on the existing infrastructure on Azure?**

### Project Setup and Sections

Initial Setup (All group members):
1. All members of the team: [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) on your machine using Homebrew.
2. Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos).

Make sure you complete the following sections in order:

#### Section 1: Terraform

1. One member in your group, create a **private** GitHub repository using a Terraform template for the **.gitignore** option. This repository will serve as the place from where you will manage your infrastructure for this week - Your Terraform project!
2. Add the other members of your group as collaborators.
3. Make a copy for your group of this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/1w6Va5g0/terraform-week-4).
4. Work through the cards on the board and have fun!

#### Section 2: Task Listing App (on Azure)

1. One member in your group, fork the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/makersacademy/task-listing-app).
2. Add the other members of your group as collaborators.
