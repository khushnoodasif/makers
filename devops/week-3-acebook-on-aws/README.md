# Acebook on AWS

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss the important things for the week
2. We'll have a short Q&A
3. You'll get into your teams and run through the [project setup](#project-setup)

## Overview of the week

- You'll work in teams to build your own CI-CD solution and to deploy an existing application using different AWS services (Your coach will announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a session about IAM on AWS
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Do you have a solid knowledge of IAM in AWS? You can explain the following concepts: users, groups, policies and roles**
* **Can you work as part of a team to build your own CI-CD solution using GitHub Actions?**
* **Can you work as part of a team to deploy an existing application on EC2?**
* **Can you apply security best practices around credentials and token storage?**
* **Are you more familiar now with potential connectivity issues that may arise as part of your system design and architecture?**
